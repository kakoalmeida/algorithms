## Hello everyone! ##

The reason why I'm creating this repo is to that I can track my learning curve in algorithms, using the C language. I will upload files here as my knowledge
increase in some matters as Data Structures, Patterns, but mostly on the programming logic itself.

### C the Programming Language
To help me in this approach, will use it as my guideline the book of the language, the ANSI Standard edition. You may see in this repo a lot of codes derivated 
from the book and the sugested exercises.

### My perspectives

I truly expect by the January, I be able to understand Data Structures and look what is best for each situation and how to use it. Also I think, that learning those 
concepts and some programming rules, will help me to develop software on others languages in a better way and give me a improved sense as programmer.
